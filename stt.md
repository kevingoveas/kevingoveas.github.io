**Project description:** An Eclipse based RCP Trace and Debug tool. The tool is used by the customers to debug the logs for the processors on the Intel mobile communication platforms.
The “SystemTraceTool” is a tool to capture the trace of the operations inside mobile station software with a desktop computer system and for decoding the captured/logged data (called a Trace). The SystemTraceTool application is the GUI (Graphical User Interface) that provides an easy to use graphical interface to view, search and analyze trace data. The actual decoding of the trace data is done by pluggable decoder libraries, dlls and scripts, which are specific to the version of the mobile station software from which the trace is captured.
