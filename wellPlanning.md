**Project description:** Comprehensive Reservoir Characterization is a critical component of understanding hydrocarbon exploitation strategies that is often avoided at Saudi Aramco simply because the current manual well planning processes take more time of their work force to determine drillable locations. 
To address this challenge Saudi Aramco would like to develop an automated well planning solution suitable to generate drillable locations utilizing existing G & G interpretation data including (3D models, 2D surfaces, Seismic) and engineering disciplines data. The automated workflow will eliminate the redundancies in well planning process and will allow them to optimize the work force time.
